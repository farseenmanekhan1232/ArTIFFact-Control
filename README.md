### JHOVE-REST container
In order to start the JHOVE REST container, use the following command
> docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 openpreserve/jhove-rest

This starts the container and exposes the server inside the container to port 8080.
In order to change the exposed port, change the number before the ':', ex. 5000:8080 to expose to port 5000.
